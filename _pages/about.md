<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Jian Lang, currently a master candidate in Software Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), under the supervision of Prof [Fan Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ihj2Rw8AAAAJ). Before that, I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Fuzhou University. 
  
My research mainly focuses on <strong>robust, reliable, and stable multimodal systems</strong> that can perform effectively under <strong>imperfect multimodal data</strong>, especially in the situations like missing modalities, distribution (domain) shifts, weak supervision (label scarcity), and data scarcity. And I am also interested in video analysis, detection, and large multimodal models for some applications.
  
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my research or potential collaboration opportunities.
